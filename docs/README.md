# Winelink
A [Winlink](http://winlink.org/) (RMS Express & VARA) installer Script for the Raspberry Pi 4.

_This project is very early in development. It has lots of bugs and should be considered [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) software._

## Installation
Copy/paste these commands into your Raspberry Pi 4's terminal:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WheezyE/Winelink/main/install_winelink.sh && \
     bash install_winelink.sh
```
 - A full installation takes about 10 minutes (with user prompts)
 - If desired, you can tell the script to only install VARA by running `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WheezyE/Winelink/main/install_winelink.sh && bash install_winelink.sh vara_only`

## Examples

## How it works
This script will help you install Box86, Wine, winetricks, Windows DLL's, RMS Express, & VARA.  You will then be prompted to configure RMS Express & VARA to send/receive audio from a USB sound card plugged into your Pi.  This installer will only work on the Raspberry Pi 4B for now (support for earlier Raspberry Pi models is planned for later).

To run Windows .exe files on RPi4 (ARM/Linux), we need an x86 emulator ([Box86](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86)) and a Windows API Call interpreter ([Wine](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine)).  Box86 is open-source and runs about 10x faster than [ExaGear](https://www.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/software/exagear.html) or [Qemu](https://github.com/qemu/qemu).  ExaGear is also closed source abandonware and Qemu (qemu-system & qemu-user-static) also has issues running more complex Wine programs on the Pi.  Box86 is much smaller in file size and much easier to install too.

## Known issues
 - ARDOP & VARA often have trouble connecting to RMS Express (over local TCP) when they first start up. Just restart RMS Express until they do connect (this is a bug in wine).
 - VARA's CPU gauge doesn't display (this is a bug in wine).
 - VARA doesn't connect to DRA boards at this time (this might be a bug in wine or box86).
 - Enabling VARA HF's waterfall display can sometimes crash VARA & RMS Express.

## Legal
All software used by this script is free and legal to use (with the exception of VARA, of course, which is shareware).  Box86, Wine, wine-mono, winetricks, and AutoHotKey, are all open-source (which avoids the legal problems of use & distribution that ExaGear had - ExaGear also ran much slower than Box86 and is no-longer maintained, despite what Huawei says these days).  All proprietary Windows DLL files required by Wine are downloaded directly from Microsoft and installed according to their redistribution guidelines.  Raspberry Pi is a trademark of the Raspberry Pi Foundation
