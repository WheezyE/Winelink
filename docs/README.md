# WinÉ˜link
A [Winlink](http://winlink.org/) (RMS Express & VARA) installer Script for the Raspberry Pi 4, Orange Pi 4 LTS, and x86/x64 Linux (Mint/Ubuntu/Debian).  Raspberry Pi 3B+ also kind of works.

_This project has lots of bugs and should be considered [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) software._

------------------------

## Installation
Copy/paste these commands into your Raspberry Pi 4's terminal:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WheezyE/Winelink/main/install_winelink.sh && \
     bash install_winelink.sh
```
###### _If desired, you can tell the script to only install VARA by running `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WheezyE/Winelink/main/install_winelink.sh && bash install_winelink.sh vara_only`_

###### _I don't have much time to maintain Winelink these days.  I've merged VARA HF into [pi-apps](https://github.com/botspot/pi-apps) as a backup option for users in case this script breaks in the future.  If needed, simply run `wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Botspot/pi-apps/master/install | bash` then run `~/pi-apps/manage install VARA\ HF` (or run pi-apps and follow the on-screen prompts) to install VARA HF._

## Known issues
 - _RMS Express sometimes won't connect (over TCP) to ARDOP & VARA. Just close RMS Express and re-open it (this is a bug in wine)._
 - _VARA's CPU gauge doesn't display (this is a bug in wine)._
 - _VARA doesn't connect to DRA boards at this time (this might be a bug in wine or box86)._
 - _Wine can sometimes freeze your OS completely if it gets overloaded. If this happens on a Raspberry Pi, you can SSH into the Pi and then run `wineserver -k` to force-quit Wine. You can also just power-off/on your system._
 - _Enabling VARA HF's waterfall display can sometimes crash RMS Express & VARA._
 - _Enabling VARA's Monitor Mode can freeze VARA. (Users might have to delete their VARA config file to recover: `rm ~/.wine/drive_c/VARA/VARA.ini`)_

## Stuff for nerds
<details><summary>How it works</summary>

This script will help you install Box86, Wine, winetricks, Windows DLL's, RMS Express, & VARA.  You will then be prompted to configure RMS Express & VARA to send/receive audio from a USB sound card plugged into your Pi.  This installer will only work on the Raspberry Pi 4B for now (support for earlier Raspberry Pi models is planned for later).

To run Windows .exe files on RPi4 (ARM/Linux), we need an x86 emulator ([Box86](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86)) and a Windows API Call interpreter ([Wine](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine)).  Box86 is open-source and runs about 5x faster than [ExaGear](https://www.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/software/exagear.html)/[Qemu](https://github.com/qemu/qemu) (see [these benchmarks](https://box86.org/2022/03/box86-box64-vs-qemu-vs-fex-vs-rosetta2/)).  ExaGear is also closed source abandonware and Qemu (qemu-system & qemu-user-static) also has issues running more complex Wine programs on the Pi.  Box86 is much smaller in file size and much easier to install too.

If you use this script in your project (or are inspired by it) just please be sure to mention ptitSeb, Box86, and myself (KI7POL).  This script is free to use, open-source, and should not be monetized (for further information see the [license file](LICENSE)).

All software used by this script is free and legal to use (with the exception of VARA, of course, which is shareware).  Box86, Wine, wine-mono, winetricks, and AutoHotKey, are all open-source (which avoids the legal problems of use & distribution that ExaGear had - ExaGear also ran much slower than Box86 and is no-longer maintained, despite what Huawei says these days).  All proprietary Windows DLL files required by Wine are downloaded directly from Microsoft and installed according to their redistribution guidelines.
