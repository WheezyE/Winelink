# About:
#    This script will help you install Box86, Wine, winetricks, Windows DLL's, Winlink (RMS Express) & VARA.  You will then
#    be asked to configure RMS Express & VARA to send/receive audio from a USB sound card plugged into your Pi.  This installer 
#    will only work on the Raspberry Pi 4B for now.  If you would like to use an older Raspberry Pi (3B+, 3B, 2B, Zero, for 
#    example), software may run very slow and you may need to compile a custom 2G/2G split memory kernel before installing.
#
#    To run Windows .exe files on RPi4, we need an x86 emulator (box86) and a Windows API Call interpreter (wine).
#    Box86 is opensource and runs about 10x faster than ExaGear or Qemu.  It's much smaller and easier to install too.
#
#    This installer should take about 10 minutes on a Raspberry Pi 4B.
#
# Distribution:
#    This script is free to use, open-source, and should not be monetized.  If you use this script in your project (or are inspired by it) just please be sure to mention ptitSeb, Box86, and myself (KI7POL).
#
# Legal:
#    All software used by this script is free and legal to use (with the exception of VARA, of course, which is shareware).  Box86 and Wine are both open-source (which avoids the legal problems of use & distribution that ExaGear had - ExaGear also ran much slower than Box86 and is no-longer maintained, despite what Huawei says these days).  All proprietary Windows DLL files required by Wine are downloaded directly from Microsoft and installed according to their redistribution guidelines.
#
# Known bugs:
#    If programs freeze, use 'wineserver -k' to restart wine.
#    The Channel Selector is functional, it just takes about 5 minutes to update its propagation indices and sometimes crashes the first time it's loaded.  Just restart it if it crashes.  If you let it run for 5 minutes, then you shouldn't have to do that again - just don't hit the Update Table Via Internet button.  I'm currently experimenting with ITS HF: http://www.greg-hand.com/hfwin32.html
#    VARA has some graphics issues if we leave window control on in Wine.  Leaving window control on in Wine is a good idea for RPi4 since it reduces CPU overhead.
#
# Donations:
#    If you feel that you are able and would like to support this project, please consider sending donations to ptitSeb or KM4ACK - without whom, this script would not exist.
#        - Sebastien "ptitSeb" Chevalier - author of "Box86": paypal.me/0ptitSeb

#
# Code overview:
#    This script has a main routine that runs subroutines.  Not all subroutines in this script are used - some are just for testing purposes.
#    This script just works for Raspberry Pi 4B at the moment, but I hope to one day have it detect CPU, OS, and distro, and install accordingly.

    #    Most post-2012 distros should have a standard '/etc/os-release' file for finding OS
    #    Pre-2012 distros (& small distros) may not have a canonical way of finding OS.
    #
    # Each release file has its own 'standard' vars, but five highly-conserved vars in all(?) os-release files are ...
    #    NAME="Alpine Linux"
    #    ID=alpine
    #    VERSION_ID=3.8.1
    #    PRETTY_NAME="Alpine Linux v3.8"
    #    HOME_URL="http://alpinelinux.org"
    #

    #
    # In general, we need to know: $ID (distro) & $VERSION_ID (distro version) into order to add Wine repo's for certain distro's/versions.
    # If $VERSION_CODENAME is available then we should probably use this for figuring out which repo to use
